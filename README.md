# Playwright Cucumber TypeScript Scripts for the Google Search and Orange HRM Login

## Project Overview

This repository contains automated testing scripts for the Google search functionality and the login feature of the Orange HRM website, built using Playwright, Cucumber, and TypeScript. The setup includes a structured approach to organizing tests and generating HTML reports after test execution.

## Key Steps:
1. Project Setup: Initialized a Node.js project and installed necessary packages, including Playwright for browser automation, Cucumber for behavior-driven development, and TypeScript for type safety.
2. TypeScript Configuration: Set up TypeScript with a tsconfig.json file to define compiler options and project structure.
3. Folder Structure: Created a well-organized folder structure for test features and step definitions.
    Feature Files: Developed a sample feature file to outline test scenarios for Google search.
    Step Definitions: Implemented step definition files that contain the logic for executing test scenarios.
4. Cucumber Configuration: Configured Cucumber to recognize TypeScript files and feature files for running tests.
5. Testing and Reporting: Enabled the execution of tests via npm scripts and integrated a reporting tool to generate HTML reports after tests run.
